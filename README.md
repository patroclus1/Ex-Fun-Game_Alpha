## This is a top-down shooter inspired by Enter the Gungeon
	(This is a pretty outdated inspiration, but still) i loved the game 
	back then and probably there will be more games 
	that i will develop in this genre.
	
<br/>

## There is only three levels to clear out
	There is a very simple idea and realization behind this game yet the focus 
	is to make it feel like the game of its genre. Particles and 
	feedback are not polished but the main goal 
	is to make everything work together.
	
<br/>

## Time limit
	With the spare time i have for development 
	i just wanted to go through the full
	cycle of developing a game.
	
<br/>

## P.S.
	As a post-release goal i plan to refactor the code.
	Because of the time limit of the jam i
	didn`t put enough effort writing 
	a clean reusable code. So 
	follow this repo to see 
	refactoring
	results
